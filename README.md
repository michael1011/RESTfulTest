### How to install

You can find the latest releases [here](https://github.com/michael1011/RESTfulTest/releases). If there isn't a compiled version that fits your system or architecture you can compile it yourself. Download the source code under the releases and execute `go build` ([Go](https://golang.org/) must be installed).
